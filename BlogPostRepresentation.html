		<h1 class="title">"Representation as a form of myth, visual communication and persuasion"</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">This blog post is based on Kidd's reading on representation</p>

		<p class="content">  Representations are socially constructed. They are made-up within the frame of a particular understanding of the world. When looking into representation and myth, Kidd(2015: 23) points out that an object can be interpreted at the denotative and connotative level which refer to the relationship of what is seen versus what is not seen at the level of the myth. For example, the Apple logo, the denotation literally is an apple and the connotative level connotes an expensive, desirable object. However, these meanings and readings can be subverted. A text, image cannot just be read at its denotative level.

			It has meaning at the level of connotation and these connotations are meanings and interpretations that are informed by the media, our different experiences and knowledge. These connotations eventually create myths. As they are naturalised and spread by the media. These representation become normalised. Kidd (2015: 24-25) points at Orientalism which is the process by which the western media create representations of the Middle East and Asia, they produce these orient representations which are stereotypical representations. With visual literacy and visual communication like images, they are open to different interpretations as compared to other mediums of communication. In terms of the connotative functions of images; they depend on the context in which the image is used. The reading and meaning of an image are informed by their mode of presentation, production context-where the image has been produced, the historical context, the context of the image in relation to other images and the reception and reading of the image. Now we find representation in the form of data visualisation. Data visualisation brings together images, symbols, tables and graphical content and they tell a story by using data (Kidd 2015:30). Data visualisation has become interactive as well. This data is presented  in ways that the audience can grasp or understand  difficult concepts or identify new patterns. With data visualisation we need to think about the implications of what is shown with such graphics and what remains missing or not represented in the data. Kidd(2015: 31) defines data visualisation as speculative and further suggest that an infographic cannot tell the entire story. This suggests that representation is constructed and not an entire representation of a particular topic or subject.
