		<h1 class="title">Interpreting the layout of web pages </h1>
		<p class="subtitle">This blog post focuses on Francisco-Revilla & Crow's research on interpreting webpages</p>
		<p class="date"> 4 September 2020</p>
		<p class="paragraph">Francisco-Revilla & Crow point out that the websites such as news, shopping websites; they make use of modular layouts. This particular practice if used effectively it enables for great layout plus the effective presentation of information in a single page (Francisco-Revilla & Crow 2009: 157). But people with normal eyesight can quickly understand these complex layout, on the flip side it poses great challenge for visually impaired users as the assistive technology like the screen readers cannot interpret the content or the layout of the webpage (Francisco-Revilla & Crow 2009: 157). Francisco-Revilla & Crow in their research had the aim of  showing how they would go about designing better assisted modular layout of webpages. With recent studies that have been conducted and that looked at the interpretation of webpages, they did not outline directly how people interpret the layout or provide data that they would compare to visually impaired people by conducting research on how people/individuals understand, interpret modular layout of websites/webpages of news shopping sites. With the study, the results showed that in terms of layout complexity, this was dependent on web pages classes  (Francisco-Revilla & Crow: 2009:163). Based on the research, Francisco-Revilla & Crow identified that users first look at elements on the page that are familiar to them which are like entry points for them. Based on the study, these elements included search bars, navigational bar. Francisco-Revilla and Crow (2009) deduced that assistive technology can be used to help users frame webpages by using entry points like search bars and call to action. 
		The presentation of information is significant for domains like online news, shopping sites. I think in general presenting information effectively is important. Presenting that information in a convenient, interesting, easy to understand manner (Francisco-Revilla & Crow 209:157). Modular layouts which are often used by newspapers, magazines is  historically being used by publishers and readers, this practice and specific conventions were used because they work for publishers plus readers. With modular layout being effective presentation strategy, it has enabled the web page authors to design these webpages by following the very same conventions (Francisco-Revilla & Crow 2009: 158). Francisco-Revilla & Crow suggest that in terms of readers perspective modular layout enable for the words to be grouped together and place related information together. This made it easier to break information down and  for the reader to understand it a lot quicker which means that the document can have more/include more information. Using this approach, layout – it is effective to users, readers that  are sighted but in terms of these users that are visually impaired; they are at a great disadvantage. Francisco-Revilla & Crow(2009:158) suggest that screen readers which is an assistive technology that can help ;interpret the content to a visually impaired user, it becomes difficult to read aloud as modular layout have what is identified as the multi-dimensional nature that is in opposition to the unidimensional interaction style of style of assistive technology. </p>

		<p class = "paragraph">Francisco-Revilla & Crow point out that there is difference between reading magazine, catalogue and reading on the web as users interact with webpages rather users browse which refers to a rapid interactive process where most of the users look at the activity that happens on the top-left quarter of the site. When accessing a webpage, the user scan it by using the skim and scan technique before they can begin reading or deciding what to do. This has quite changed over the user experience practices being diversified, websites now use call to action and also implemented practices and conventions in which they can drive users to read the content. With eye-tracking studies providing basics for understanding the ways in which sighted users break down and interpret the web pages. The eye-tracking studies have pointed out that there is a behaviour that is used such as scan paths, gaze fixations, banner blindness. This enabled designers to rethink their pages using metrics such as time to find ways to drive users to click in order to point at the reading issues and also improve aspects/elements like images size and positioning (Francisco-Revilla &Crow 2009:159). In terms of the reinterpretation process, the participants showed the same pattern when interpreting webpages which was described as the normalized interpretation process, this showed that the participants looked at navigation bar, column in the middle and column on the right. With some of the observations showed that people followed a top-down left to right process (Francisco-Revilla & Crow 2009: 164). In terms of the framing and reference points, participant framed or referenced navigation bar as the entry point, with most of the time they mentioned the navigation bar as part of the first two steps in the process (Francisco-Revilla & Crow 2009: 164).The study and research that was conducted proved that most participants looked at the contents of the web page, most people also read and interpret web pages from top to bottom, left and right. In terms of the advertisement and banners these were mostly ignored. Francisco-Revilla & Crow also suggest that the perception of the layout complexity is highly affected by the user’s familiarity with the elements like medium, or how much the individual or user likes the layout but we should also not presume that the user is ok with the layout complexity because they are familiar with the page. Francisco-Revilla & Crow conclude by stating that how users interpret of the webpage layout has an effect on the development of assistive technologies. As this technology must be able to identify the elements and be able to use them as reference points but also interpret the layout modules and convey all this information in appropriate ways. 
		Since the first website in 1991; website layout have changed frequently. There are more website layouts that are used. In an article, Beardy(2020) points out that layouts in terms of their designs have grew in complexity like the multi-layout column. I think website layouts have grew to feature lots of different webpage layout. With the layouts, designers are now also breaking the traditional way of presenting information; they have come up with innovative and different ways to layout webpages. This ultimately does change how users interpret and understand a website. This means that assistive technology has to also frequently change how it interprets and reads the layout. Looking at the development of the use of mobile phones; it also has had an impact in terms of the layout. The changed has shown different layouts from F-pattern layout, Z-pattern layout to Fullscreen image layouts and many more (Spivak 2020). These layouts are different however they still need to offer entry points for the visually impaired users and for assistive technology to be able to read/interpret the layout of any webpage. this research points to accessibility meaning that websites should be accessible. By accessibility we are no longer pointing to the practice of making the website accessible to people as possible and this is not only for disabled people, visually impaired people but we need to think about the network, mobile devices, the different fonts that we use.
