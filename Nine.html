		<h1 class="title">Interpreting the layout of web pages </h1>
		<p class="subtitle">This blog post focuses on Francisco-Revilla & Crow's research on interpreting webpages</p>
		<p class="date"> 4 September 2020</p>
		<p class="paragraph"> Francisco-Revilla & Crow point out that the websites such as news, shopping websites; they make use of modular layouts. This particular practice if used effectively it enables for great layout plus the effective presentation of information in a single page (Francisco-Revilla & Crow 2009: 157). But people with normal eyesight can quickly understand these complex layout, on the flip side it poses great challenge for visually impaired users as the assistive technology like the screen readers cannot interpret the content or the layout of the webpage. Francisco-Revilla & Crow in their research had the aim of showing how they would go about designing better assisted modular layout of webpages. By conducting research on how people individuals understand, interpret modular layout of websites/webpages of news shopping sites. Based on the research, the result suggested that when the layout is as complex, the reading interpretation and understanding of the complex layout takes a long time. Francisco-Revilla & Crow identified that users first look at elements on the page that are familiar to them which are like entry points for them. Based on the study, these elements included search bars, navigational bar. Francisco-Revilla and Crow (2009) deduced that assistive technology can be used to help users frame webpages by using entry points like search bars and call to action. 
        The presentation of information is significant for domains like online news, shopping sites. I think in general presenting information effectively is important. Presenting that information in a convenient, interesting, easy to understand manner (Francisco-Revilla & Crow 209:157). Modular layouts which are often used by newspapers, magazines is  historically being used by publishers and readers, this practice and specific conventions were used because they work for publishers plus readers. With modular layouts, they often clean using simple appearance with users/readers viewers prefer them as they are entry points and reference points for users. With modular layout being effective presentation strategy, it has enabled the web page authors to design these webpages by following the very same conventions (Francisco-Revilla & Crow 2009: 158). it becomes essential to interpreting and reading understanding the contents of webpages. Using this approach, layout â€“ it is effective to users, readers that  are sighted but in terms of these users that are visually impaired; they are at a great disadvantage. This is because screen readers, assistive technologies while they can read aloud the content of a webpage, modular page layout have multi-dimensional nature that is an opposition to the unidimensional interaction style of assistive technology (Francisco-Revilla & Crow 2009:158). </p>
        <p class="paragraph">With the modular layout being used and adapted throughout history, research on legibility. This has made modular layout the favoured presentation for information. Francisco-Revilla & Crow suggest that in terms of readers perspective modular layout enable for the words in groups related information, making it easier to break information down and understand it a lot quicker which means that the document can have more/include more information/words as they consume the information perceptually. There is a difference between reading magazine, catalogue and reading on the web as users use but also interact with webpages rather users browse which refers to a rapid interactive process where most of the users look at the activity that happens on the top-left quarter of the site. With webpages users access a webpage, the user would scan it like skim and scan technique before they can begin reading or deciding what to do. This has quite changed over the user experience practices being diversified, websites now use call to action and also implemented practices and conventions in which they can drive users to read the content. This is also has enabled for the use of entry points allowing users to click that as it is highly contrast to every element in site. With eye-tracking studies providing basics for understanding the ways in which sighted users break down and interpret the web pages. The eye-tracking studies have pointed out that there is a behaviour that is used such as scan paths, gaze fixations, banner blindness. This enabled designers to rethink their pages using metrics such as time to find time to click in order to point at the reading issues and also improve aspects/elements like images size and positioning (Francisco-Revilla &Crow 2009:159). With recent studies looking at the layout of webpages and that have conducted, they did not outline directly how people interpret the layout or provide data that they would compare to visually impaired people. With the study, the results showed that in terms of layout complexity, this was dependent on web pages classes (Francisco-Revilla & Crow: 2009:163). In terms of the reinterpretation process, the participants showed the same pattern when interpreting webpages which was described as the normalized interpretation process showed that the participants looked at navigation bar, column in the middle and column on the right. With some of the observations showed that people followed a top-down left to right process (Francisco-Revilla & Crow 2009: 164). In terms of the framing and reference points, participant framed or referenced navigation bar as the entry point, with most of the time the mentioned the navigation bar as part of the first two steps in the process (Francisco-Revilla & Crow 2009: 164).The study and research that was conducted proved certain points like that most participants looked at the contents of the web page, most people also read and interpret web pages from top to bottom, left and right. in terms of the advertisement and banners are mostly ignored. Also, this suggest that the way individuals view layout complexity is likely to be related to the number of modules, the more modules, the complexity is higher. Francisco-Revilla & Crow also suggest that the perception of the layout complexity is highly affected by the elements like medium, or how much the individual or user like the layout but we should also not presume that the user is ok with the layout complexity because they are familiar with the page. The Francisco-Revilla & Crow conclude by stating that the how they interpret of the webpage layout has an effect on the development of assistive technologies. As this technology must be able to identify the elements and be able to use them as reference points but also interpret the layout modules and convey all this information in appropriate ways.
