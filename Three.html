		<p class="subtitle">This blog post is a close reading of Bush's text about his visionary for what we call today, wikipedia-internet</p>
		<p class="date"> 5 August 2020</p>
		<p class="content"> In his essay, Bush outlines a problem to the scientists post world war. Bush’s vision outlines “that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge” (Bush 1979: 36). In post-world war, Bush suggests that there is a growth/rise of research and the methods that are used are very old. He presents that scientific efforts should make previous collected human knowledge more accessible through the machine. This means turning the excessive information ‘bewildering store of knowledge more accessible. In his essay, Bush offers his vision for some of the aspects of information society. Bush offers the solution which is the memex which supposedly to offer his creation/idea of access to knowledge. His vision suggests that inventions have extended man’s physical power rather than the powers of his mind. 
		He suggests full automation of computational and calculations. For example, he suggests that moving from abacus to modern knowledge accounting machine. These range from calculation automation to instant camera photography, dry photography where an individual will not have to wait for the images to dry. Bush refers to the machine as the system that can process information and data at a fast pace and rate.  Selecting and indexing as part of the vision. Bush coins the term “memex” which refers to  device in which an individual stores all books, records and communications which is mechanized, and people can consult with speed and flexibility. The memex storing and indexing  every information, making it easier for the individuals to search for information. Bush’s vision was information system through which machines process information and data at a fast pace. In addition to his visionary is the hope to excessive information accessible and a storage for knowledge. This is similar to the Borges’s problem of excessive information in his story/writing “The library of Babel”.
