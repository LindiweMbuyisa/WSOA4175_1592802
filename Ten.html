		<h1 class="title">Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information.</h1>
		<p class="subtitle"></p>
		<p class="date"> 11 September 2020</p>
		<p class="paragraph"> Graham et al (2015) point out that information has always had geography. It is from somewhere about somewhere. Graham et al (2015) point out that the information are mediated by networks, technologies existing in physical, material places. The authors point out that these geographies of information about places matter because they shape how we are able to find and understand different parts of the world. In this paper, the research results  showed that not only are geographies of uneven access to contemporary modes of communication however there are also uneven geographies of participation production of information-knowledge and further lack of representation in the information. 
        To demonstrate the uneven geographies of participation, the authors look at 3 different variables, domain names, GitHub users, Wikipedia edits. There is a difference between internet population and access to participation in the internet creation, innovation, distribution, western control the internet. “Places invisible or discounted in representation are invisible in practice to many people.  Graham et al (2015) suggest that geographic augmentations are way more than representation of places they are a part of it, they shape it rather than opposed to reflect it. The authors set out/aimed to explore how information geographies have their own geographic distributions: geographies of access, of participation and of representation. The authors offer a range of key platforms that mediate, host and delivers different types of geographies. The paper also demonstrates that in addition to the geographies of uneven access to contemporary modes of communication uneven geographies of participation and representation show. The authors suggest that information geographies are being perpetuated rather than being alleviated or challenged. The authors identify that these unchangeable augmentations of information about places are of importance because as these augmentations shape how we are able to find and understand the world and as its different parts. How these places are represented being invisible within informational augmentation changes how they are used (Graham et al 2015: 89). The authors point out that geography of information has been a key to the means of control and power formation.  </p>
		<p class="paragraph">As the research is a starting point. This research looks at how the information geographies have geographic distributions, geographies of access, of participation and of representation. The authors point out that the information are produced under the banner of power (Graham et al 2015: 90). Books, media, text in general have been produced form the global North and these  are  consumed by the global South, the global South contributing a small role in producing, creating. Castells identifies that Africa as a whole is left out in technology. The authors point out that information power, power over information expressed into different spatial patterns, all of the traditional mediums of information are characterised by significant inequalities. In reference to Castell of the systemic uneven relationship between information production/use; socio economic exclusion and marginalisation as the black holes of informational capitalism (Graham et al 2015: 91). The authors point out that there has been a change possibly a revolution of availability of information. We have seen some radical changes, the different ways in which information is produced and used. We are now in this age of post-information scarcity. The authors point out this changes is the result of new socio technical systems of the information age. This is also because of much larger accessibility to computers. The authors set out to answer/research with the increase of connectivity, devices have also increased. The authors question if the increase of access changed participation or representation but also how has the increase in connectivity changed the political economy of information how this has changed the technical systems identified by scholars. Further if because of more people create and access information, if there are different geographies of participation and representation/new layers of digital augmentations.

		<p class="paragraph">The research focuses on 3 categories.  Geographies of access and enablement. With this part of they explore who has access and enablement. This allowed for gaining insight and understanding of distribution of technologies and services. With the digital engagement mapped, it points to internet users and total populations datasets from the World Bank, internet connections which has backed internet users and internet connections per country showed that China does have the largest internet population. With other countries like USA, India, Japan also behind China as they also have a huge number of internet users however they have less penetration compared to Europe, North America. similar to India has a large number of internet users, there is less penetration. In terms of Africa, they are between < 20 and 20-40 percent of penetration.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">The authors further look at the uneven pattern in the geography of internet access; this is different across different places. With Global North, the cost is relatively low whilst Africa; the average cost is quite high, the cost range from 10% to 250% of the average income of the individuals (Graham et al 2015:92). This is because of how the internet cables are placed connected which means that there is politics in how the internet cables are placed. South Africa is one of the countries that has the highest data prices with the trend that took place on social media platforms with the hashtag data must fall. According to the research company tariff compared the prices that South Africans pay for data-only packages compared to Brazil, Russia, India and China. Also compared to South Africa’s data-only pricing to the African countries like Kenya with the emerging market and developed market of Australia (Van Zyl 2016). The comparison was against the average data contract prices across the use of local mobile network operators with the results demonstrating that SA has the second highest data contract prices in the group. Data prices for South Africa were on average 134% more expensive that the cheapest prices in the group so 1GB would be R77 in South Africa whereas in Brazil it would be R210, Russia it would be R32 and India the data costs would be R53. This was the data cost measured in 2016 (Van Zyl 2016). </p>

		<p class="paragraph">In the research exploration of participation, the authors look at 3 different variables domain web which allowed for the authors to indicate content produced on the web. GitHub was used to measure contribution and Wikipedia. The research result showed that the 78% of domains are registered in Europe or North America with Asia only having 13% of the world domains, Latin America  which is 5% and Oceania which is 13% and with the middle east and Africa only making up 2% combined of the world domains. The authors deduce that the large numbers of internet users does not mean or entail that there is a large number of domain registration in reference to China (Graham et al 2015:95).</p>

		<p class="paragraph"> This concludes that there is a big difference between access of information and participation in tis creation (Distribution as we can America (North), West are the producers of this content. When looking at the GitHub quantitative results, this also skewed and shows an uneven pattern in terms of contributions on GitHub. There is a disproportionally concentrated within Europe and North America, this measurement of content creation also shows uneven patterns. It is not only with domain names of websites but software. North America and Europe contribute to a higher rate than any other region in the world (Graham et al 2015:96). In terms of Wikipedia contributions also shows unevenness. The authors have recorded that there are inequalities as edits/contribution are from user located in the US in comparison to Africa; there are only a few edits that demonstrated to be from Africa and the Middle East. Looking at geographies of representation. To understand the representation within the immutable augmentation of world; The authors analyse the geographies of series of different digital representations: Google search, Open Street map, semantic web, geonames. The research result show that there are patterns of unevenness with different platforms that allow for the representation of places. The authors point out that how can the geographies of information be more inclusive and less uneven. it is about decolonising but also it is about focusing more attentively about how this can impact or have an effect on post-colonial modes of information governance. The research while it does not detail the causes; the question of why there are these disproportional, uneven geographies of why there are uneven geographies. the authors point to the idea of decolonising, disentangling the mutability, immutability of information mapping and critically questioning the power of what is made visible versus invisible. </p>
