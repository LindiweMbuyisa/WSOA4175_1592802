		<h1 class="title">"A research center for augmetning human intellect</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">This blog post is a close reading on the reading "The research center for augmenting human intellect</p>
		<p class="date">15 July 2020</p>
		<p class="content">  The reading points to researchers who set out to develop an experimental laboratory around an interactive multi-console computer display system, they set out to be working to learn the principles by which interactive computer aids can augment their intellectual capability. The research objective/goals was to develop a theory and ways of designing an augmentation system. The research has inspired, influenced the idea of computing software/hardware. The functionality of computer, tablet, Pc was inspired by Engelbert and English. 
		This text highlights a multi-sponsor research center that took place at Stanford Research Institute which developed the main computer interaction. This featured a time-sharing computer with a 4.5 megabyte,  96megabyte file storage disk. The display being high-resolution commercial television monitor, providing character vector portrayals. This features typewriter keyboard with a SRI cursor device which allowed for screen pointing, selection. This was held by the user, XY transducer which placed on a surface preferably a flat surface. With the user files being organised in a form of hierarchical structures of data entities compromising of text, figures. This allowed for the user to composed study and change these files at a fast speed, flexibility but also change and modify quickly. 
		In the augmented human intellect research center at Stanford Research institute  which develop an experimental lab which focused on creating/developing an interactive, multi-console, computer display system; they were looking to learn the principles by which interactive computer aids can augment their intellectual capability (233). This research’s main objective was to develop theory but also ways in which they can use for designing an “augmenting system”. This research was highly empirical. With he research, the special activities of the group are the evolutionary development of a complex hardware-software system. The research aimed at augmenting a system development project but also the primary research aimed at creating principles/rules of analysis and design so as to understand how to augment human capability. This research is not only for specific disciplines, but they hoped that this system can help others come up with augmentation systems to help other disciplines plus activities. What this research does is that it set out to reach the point where users can do work online, all of our activities via the consoles/computer.
