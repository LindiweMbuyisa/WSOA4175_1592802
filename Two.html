		<h1 class="title">The History of Data Visualisation</h1>
		
		<p class="date">29 July 2020</p>

		<p class="paragraph"> In this chapter, Friendly points out that there is a rich history behind data visualisation than we think (Friendly 2008: 1).  We often view statistical graphics and data visualisation as modern developments in statistics but if we were to look into the roots and the history of graphic representation, it dates back to pre-17th century. 
		</p>
		<p class="paragraph">Friendly revisits the history of data visualisation further questions what the reason behind the development of data visualisation was and what its relation to other forms of graphic representation. Data visualisation as a form of graphic visualisation dates back to pre-17th century where visualisation was maps and diagrams (Friendly 2008: 3). The pre-forms of visualisation stemmed from geometric diagrams in tables of the position of stars and celestial bodies in the making of maps which were to aid in navigation and exploration (Friendly 2008). </p> 

		<h2>1600-1699</h2>  
	
		<p class="paragraph"> In this specific period (1600 - 1699), data visualisation was concerned with measurement like time, distance and space. This data visualisation period expanded in theory and the rise of practical applications which saw the rise of analytical geometry and coordinate systems (Friendly 2008: 4-5). </p>
	
		 <h2> 1700-1799 marked as the rise of new graphic forms.</h2> 
	
		 <p class="paragraph"> New data representations like the isoline and contours were invented, and thematic mappings of physical quantities were created (Friendly 2008: 7). There was also a rise of abstract graphs, graphs of functions became more widespread along with the early beginnings of statistical theory.  </p> 
	
		 <h2> 1800-1850 marked the beginnings of modern graphics like the pie chart, line graph and bar graph.</h2>
	
		 <p class="paragraph"> 1800-1850 saw the growth of the graphical forms, statistical graphics and thematic mappings. The new and modern graphic forms and thematic maps offered multiple new ways to show quantitative information on maps. </p> 
		
		  <h2>1850-1900 marked as the golden age of statistical graphics. </h2> 
	
		  <p class="paragraph">This period saw alot of different innovations in statistical graphics and thematic cartography. These were used in multiple ways and had different variations such as escaping flatland which was the display of more than two variables at the same time in different ways.  </p> 
		
		  <h2> 1900-1950 marked as the modern dark ages of visualisation. </h2>
	
		  <p class="paragraph">This period saw visualisation of graphical innovations which incorporated new ideas and technology. Between 1950-1975, this period referred to as the re-birth of visualisation. Friendly points out that this was influenced by significant events that allowed for data visualisation to be used for data analysis as a legitimate branch of statistics and many more methods and across disciplines. </p> 
	
		  	<h2>1975-present</h2> 
	
		   <p class="paragraph">This period showed a High-D, interactive and dynamic data visualisation. During this period the data visualisation had become used in multi-disciplinary research areas. Friendly further suggest that data visualisation has become more varied and developed at a fast pace. Eventually became more used in a wide range of disciplines.  </p>

		   <p class="paragraph">As mention in the previous blog post, data visualisation as another new form of representation which brings together images, symbols and graphical content to tell a story using data. While it can make it easier for the reader/viewer to grasp or understand information, data visualisation is constructive and speculative. Similar to image representation when visualising data, we select what to include and what to exclude. This ultimately can influence how the audience reads/views the data. What this means is that data visualisation can do ideological work, privileging certain views of the world and hiding others but also can perpetuate existing power relations. Data visualisation is the result of selecting data and presenting data. For example, with John Snow’s cholera map focusing on certain specific districts that are decisions. This decision to frame and focus on certain districts excludes the individuals living in other districts or areas. Furthermore his data visualisation of the cholera map obscures the the European expansion and colonial pursuits happening at the time. This priviledges only a certain view, the cholera disease that affected Leeds. When visualising data, there are decisions that influence, shape data and visual representation of the data. Data visualisation as another form of representation, it is shaped for example, who is included in the data versus excluded in the data set determines how readers understand and interpret the world. Similar to images representation, data visualisation has the ability to produce/create myths and perpetuate certain ideologies. This can make certain ideas normalised.  </p>
		


			
            <h2>An Analysis of a Historic Data visualisation</h2>
         
            <p class="paragraph">Using John Snow’s cholera map which was based on Dr Robert Bark’s cholera map of Leeds and was a representation of the different districts that were affected by cholera. John Snow (1855) who created an adaptation of the map of the different regions and districts that were affected by cholera used the map to track and identify all the individuals/households that were affected by cholera. The map not only indicates the different information of the individuals in homes that suffered from cholera but also indicated information about which households would have been affected based on which area they collected their water. The map indicated the different houses that had some with a dot and representing the source of where the homes were collecting their water from. The denotative level of the map means or is a representation of the city of London that shows the streets and the different districts in the city.  The connotative as I have noted in the previous blog is the deeper meaning and interpretation because of our background and culture. Snow’s cholera map only focuses on the affected districts, areas and what could have caused the cholera disease and that is a decision in itself. Depedning on the who was included in the data visulisation determines how readers understand the world. Due to the datat visualisation framed in such a manner, it hides the european expansion and colonialism that occurred in 1855.
