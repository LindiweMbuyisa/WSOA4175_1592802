		<h1 class="title">The History of Data Visualisation</h1>
		
		<p class="date">29 July 2020</p>

		<p class="paragraph"> Friendly points out that there is a rich history behind data visualisation than we think (Friendly 2008: 1).  We often view statistical graphics and data visualisation as modern developments in statistics but if we were to look into the roots and the history of graphic representation, it dates back to pre-17th century. 
		</p>
		<p class="paragraph">Friendly recounts and revisits the history of data visualisation further questions what the reason behind the development of data visualisation was and what its relation to other forms of graphic representation. Data visualisation as a form of graphic visualisation dates back to pre-17th century where visualisation was maps and diagrams (Friendly 2008: 3). The pre-forms of visualisation stemmed from geometric diagrams in tables of the position of stars and celestial bodies in the making of maps which were to aid in navigation and exploration (Friendly 2008). </p> 

		<h2>1600-1699</h2>  
	
		<p class="paragraph"> In this specific period (1600 - 1699), data visualisation was concerned with measurement, time, distance and space. This data visualisation period expanded in theory and the rise of practical applications which saw the rise of analytical geometry and coordinate systems (Friendly 2008: 4-5). </p>
	
		 <h2> 1700-1799 marked as the rise of new graphic forms.</h2> 
	
		 <p class="paragraph"> New data representations like the isoline and contours were invented, and thematic mappings of physical quantities were created (Friendly 2008: 7). There was also a rise of abstract graphs, graphs of functions became more widespread along with the early beginnings of statistical theory.  </p> 
	
		 <h2> 1800-1850 marked the beginnings of modern graphics like the pie chart, line graph and bar graph.</h2>
	
		 <p class="paragraph"> 1800-1850 saw the growth of the graphical forms, statistical graphics and thematic mappings. The new and modern graphic forms and thematic maps offered multiple new ways to show quantitative information on maps. </p> 
		
		  <h2>1850-1900 marked as the golden age of statistical graphics. </h2> 
	
		  <p class="paragraph">This period saw alot of different innovations in statistical graphics and thematic cartography. These were multiple and had different variations such as Escaping flatland which was the display of more than two variables at the same time in different ways.  </p> 
		
		  <h2> 1900-1950 marked as the modern dark ages of visualisation. </h2>
	
		  <p class="paragraph">This period saw visualisation of graphical innovations which incorporated new ideas and technology. Between 1950-1975, this period referred to as the re-birth of visualisation. Friendly points out that this was influenced by significant events that allowed for data visualisation to be used for data analysis as a legitimate branch of statistics and many more methods and across disciplines. </p> 
	
		  	<h2>1975-present</h2> 
	
		   <p class="paragraph">This period showed a High-D, interactive and dynamic data visualisation. During this period the data visualisation had become used in multi-disciplinary research areas. Friendly further suggest that data visualisation has become more varied and developed at a fast pace. Eventually became more used in a wide range of disciplines.  </p>

            <h2>An Analysis of a Historic Data visualisation</h2>
         
            <p class="paragraph">Using John Snow’s cholera map which was based on Dr Robert Bark’s cholera map of Leeds -1833 which was a representation of the different districts that were affected by cholera. John Snow’ (1855) who showed an adaptation of the map of the different regions and districts that were affected by cholera. John Snow used the map to track and identify the cholera cases on the map. The map displays a solution and relation to the production of cholera. He used a map to record the homes in the different districts that were affected by cholera. The map indicated the information of the houses of the victim with a dot and representing the source of where the homes were collecting their water from. The denotative level of the map means or is a representation of the city of London that shows and displays the streets and navigation. The connotative level represents the statistics behind the cholera outbreak and representing the correlation between the water pump and the cholera disease. With the snow's map of the cholera outbreak. it only shows the specific districts that were affected. It focuses only on the cholera disease; the result focused on specific districts. Its focus is only on the cholera disease; the resulting data are also focused on specific districts. </p>
