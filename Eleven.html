		<h1 class="title">"The Fourth Industrial Revolution-The Case of South Africa"</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">This blog post highlights Sutherland exploration Fourth Industrial Revolution in the South African context.</p>
		<p class="date">15 September 2020</p>
		<p class="paragraph">  In this article, Sutherland(2019) explores what the fourth industrial revolution might entail or mean and what it might deliver for South Africa. Considering that the President of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa looks at incorporating the 4IR into his national economic strategy. Sutherland notes that the fourth industrial revolution is not the result of a planned historical analysis but it is being used as a tool/device by those who are trying to create and invent a new specific economic and commercial futures which is about driving the idea of full automation and connectivity (Sutherland 2019: 2). By developing these fourth industrial revolution technologies, Sutherland(2019) notes that these have a major impact as these ideas have the capability to destroy jobs, decrease wages, increasing the inequality (Sutherland 2019:2). The 4th industrial revolution is a highly elite innovation which is only set to benefit the Davos community and the capitalist society at large. In a South African context, a country which is unequal, the economy really deeply rooted in the informal sector,  with high unemployment rate, most of the citizens lacking the most basic skills let alone the advanced skills that come with the fourth industrial revolution technologies (Sutherland 2019:2). Sutherland identifies the 3 previous industrial revolutions, the roles they played in Africa. He further discusses the industry policy in South Africa. Furthermore, evaluating industrial automation as a driver of change. </p>
		<p class="paragraph">In reviewing and looking at the past industrial revolution and the roles in Africa, Sutherland points out that the economic history includes 3 industrial revolutions. The first being the British industrial revolution has evolved over the centuries. The first industrial revolution (1760-1850) originating in the United kingdom, economies shifted from rural agrarian to urban mechanised production. This was the introduction of the use water and steam power to merchandise production. The second industrial revolution which was in the 1870-1970. This was the introduction of electricity which allowed for the mass production with the US leading the shift to mass production, distribution and communication. With electricity applied to communication lighting and motors. The third industrial revolution which began in 1960s which was also led by the US saw the introduction of ICT, the use of IT and the internet to digitise production, distribution and services. The 4th industrial revolution is a visionary plan which countries all over the world are trying to adopt game changing technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics. He points out that these 4IR strategies or the revolution itself is a rhetorical more than it being an analytical device (Sutherland 2019: 4).</p>
		<p class ="paragraph">While Sutherland points out that Africa has seen a change in terms of economy between the 2000-2017, it is still less because of the strong demographic but also with the lack of good jobs, inequalities and migration (Sutherland 2019: 2).  Sutherland(2019) points out that the legal and policy frameworks for infrastructure have been a problem let alone the changes have been so slow but also there has been poor quality drafting and insufficient parliament scrutiny of legislation, weak regulation and excessive reliance on poorly controlled and financed state owned enterprises. South Africa is basically famous for creating and drafting these legislations but also fail to implement these legislation. Not to mention the Corruption that South Africa has graced, this has had an impact on the electricity generator, Eskom further the railway company. Also, the corruption has seen the SAA airline and the SABC bankrupt. While the policies have been drafted and only becoming operational after two decades of preparation, it suggests that these policies need to be implemented (Sutherland 2019: 3). Furthermore the education system cannot produce graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. also, there are not enough of the systems to train and retrain citizens/people about information and communication technology skills (Sutherland 2019: 3). Sutherland (2019) notes that while we can see finance for start-ups technology hubs, we have seen growth in that sector; these have not had an economic effect yet. Concerns around the 4IR are the job losses and full automation of work. With the aims and goal of the South African Industrial policy, they have set out to maintain and create new job opportunities and to support the economic growth, however this is in opposition to the fourth industrial revolution which risks jobs being destroyed by automation, robotization. The Fourth industrial revolution as Sutherland suggests that it needs attention and engagement with the processes. Sutherland(2019) suggests increasing the spending in research, development, increasing the number of students in studying STEM subjects, improving the school system. Sutherland points out that the challenges are tough and daunting but there should be a formulation of new policies for the economy, education, industry, science and technology which these policies need to be sophisticated and should be implemented way faster. They also require the understanding of the failures of the past and coordination of implementation across government and with industry. Sutherland points out that the 4IR is only to benefit the Davos community rather than the economic history. The 4IR strategy is only set to benefit the capitalist society only widening the gap between rich and poor. In a South African context, 4IR strategy; Sutherland suggests that South Africa should approach 4IR in a democratic, accountable; transparent way. The author further calls for more research regarding the 4IR in order to understand and get insight into the limitations of the South African government in implementing the policy that could potentially help the economy but also looking in comparison to other developing countries and their strategies to implementing the 4IR technologies.  </p>
