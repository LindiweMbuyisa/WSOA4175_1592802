		<h1 class="title">"The Fourth Industrial Revolution-The Case of South Africa"</h1>
		
		<p class="date">15 September 2020</p>
		<p class="paragraph">  In this article, Sutherland explores what the fourth industrial revolution(4IR) might entail for South Africa. Considering that the President of South Africa, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa looks at incorporating the 4IR into his national economic strategy. I want to begin by explaining what an industrial revolution might entail. Based on the previous 3 revolutions, industrial revolution refers to new enabled ways in which trigger major changes in the economic and social structures which these changes include how we communicate with each but also get from point A to B. Sutherland notes that the fourth industrial revolution is not the result of a planned historical analysis but it is being used as a tool/device by those who are trying to create and invent a new specific economic and commercial futures which are about driving the idea of full automation and connectivity (Sutherland 2019: 2). By developing these fourth industrial revolution technologies, Sutherland notes that these have a major impact as these ideas can destroy jobs, decrease wages, perpetuate the existing inequalities (Sutherland 2019:2). The 4th industrial revolution is a highly elite innovation which is only set to benefit the Davos community and the capitalist society at large. In a South African context which firstly is an unequal country, the economy deeply rooted in the informal sector,  with the high unemployment rate and most of the citizens lacking the most basic skills let alone the advanced skills that come with the fourth industrial revolution technologies (Sutherland 2019:2). Sutherland identifies the 3 previous industrial revolutions, the roles they played in Africa. He further discusses the industry policy in South Africa. Furthermore, evaluating industrial automation as a driver of change.  </p>
		<p class="paragraph"> Sutherland points out that economic history includes 3 industrial revolutions, the first being the British industrial revolution which occurred in 1760-1850 originating in the United Kingdom. This industrial revolution was a shift from rural agrarian to urban mechanic production. This was the introduction of the used water and steam power to merchandise production. The second industrial revolution which was between 1870-1970. This was the introduction of electricity which allowed for the mass production with the US leading the shift to mass production, distribution and communication. The third industrial revolution which began in the 1960s which was also led by the US saw the introduction of ICT, the use of IT and the internet to digitise production, distribution and services. The 4th industrial revolution is a visionary plan which countries all around the world are trying to adopt game-changing technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics. He points out that these 4IR strategies or the revolution itself are a rhetorical more than it is an analytical device (Sutherland 2019: 4). </p>
		<p class ="paragraph"> While Africa has not seen a significant change between 2000-2017, only a small change especially considering the strong demographic but also with the lack of good jobs, inequalities and migration (Sutherland 2019: 2). Sutherland(2019) argues that  the legal and policy frameworks for infrastructure have been a problem in terms of the drafting process but also the legal and policy frameworks have not been implemented or it has taken a long time for these policies to be implemented. To add onto the list there has been an insufficient parliament scrutiny of legislation, weak regulation and excessive reliance on poorly controlled and financed state-owned enterprises. Furthermore, the education system cannot produce graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Also, there are not enough of the systems to train and retrain citizens/people about information and communication technology skills (Sutherland 2019: 3). Sutherland (2019) notes that while we can see finance for start-ups technology hubs, we have seen growth in that sector; these have not had an economic effect yet. Concerns around the 4IR are the job losses and full automation of work. With the aims and goal of the South African Industrial policy, they have set out to maintain and create new job opportunities and to support the economic growth however, this is in opposition to the fourth industrial revolution which risks jobs being destroyed by automation, robotization. The Fourth industrial revolution as Sutherland suggests that it needs attention and engagement with the processes. Sutherland(2019) suggests increasing the spending in research, development, increasing the number of students in studying STEM subjects, improving the school system will be better prepare for the 4IR. As the education system is  still designed for the 2nd industrial revolution. This has been demonstrated vividly during these times (Covid19) when everything is online and relies on connectivity however being difficult for some individuals because they do not own a smartphone, laptop or live in an area where connectivity is always problematic.
		Sutherland points out that the challenges are tough and daunting but there should be a formulation of new policies for the economy, education, industry, science and technology which these policies need to be sophisticated and should be implemented way faster. They also require the understanding of the failures of the past and coordination of implementation across government and with industry. Sutherland points out that the 4IR is only to benefit the Davos community rather than the economic history.  What this means is that the 4IR strategy is only set to benefit the capitalist society only widening the gap between rich and poor. In a South African context, Sutherland suggests that South Africa should approach 4IR in a democratic, accountable and transparent way. Sutherland further calls for more research on the 4IR to understand and get insight into the limitations of the South African government in implementing the policy that could potentially help the economy but also looking in comparison to other developing countries and their strategies to implementing the 4IR technologies.  Sutherland gives a very optimistic perspective to the 4IR  however I want to point out some of the issues that Sutherland does not raise. Let's start with 2008- which was a major financial crisis; the problems that arised from that economic downfall have not been solved. Majority of the high unemployment rate stems of 2008 as that economic period left alot of people without jobs and struggling to put food on the table. With the 4IR strategy the technology is presented as a way to alleviate poverty and equalise society however the 3rd industrial revolution already created a digital divide. How are we implementing a 4IR strategy when alot of children still lack the basic education, still do not have textbooks and learning under trees instead of classrooms. I admire Sutherland's optimism towards the implementation of the 4IR strategy and suggesting that South Africa has the possibility of implementing the 4IR. But also, we need to consider that these technologies that come with 4IR strategy are western ideas and being implemented in Africa whereby there is still poverty and lack of skills. Shouldn't we be priotising the basic education over 4IR. Another point is that 4IR drives entrepreneurship/start-ups but people are still not taught/given information on how to start a business. Sutherland argues that more research and policy drafting will better prepare South Africa however I think that people need to be given a better understanding of how to use the technology and better their lives, better involving the communities and teaching people how to navigate the 4IR.
