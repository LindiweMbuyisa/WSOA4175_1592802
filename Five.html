		<h1 class="title">"The World Wide Web"</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">In this blog post I addressed Bernes-Lee's proposal for the web but further looked into the web's current state and future based on Hanson's article on how the web has changed and is different from what Tim-Bernes-Lee proposed in his proposal/essay</p>
		<p class="date">15 August 2020</p>
		<p class="paragraph">  
 		 The web has become more than a framework encompassing/including human knowledge as a hypertext system. It has further become more than a pool of human knowledge as Bernes Lee points out (Bernes-Lee 1994: 791). It has made available or accessible a world wide web that  has the most information than ever before, more than we have ever seen in comparison to a physical space like a library. (Bernes-Lee 1994:791). The world wide web has inevitably grown to become a place where individuals share information more than just that people can host their business websites but also conduct financial transactions and shop online. This article as the original published proposal, it suggested the foundation for the web as we have come to witness that the invention of the web has had an influential part in our lives. During the writing of the proposal what Bernes-Lee had envisioned with the web was a different number of things. The web defined a boundless information world of which the all the items or information had a reference which could be retrieved. It represented the address system (URL) which refers to the universal resource identifier, the network protocol which is used by the servers which were able to give the web servers performance and features. Further the web had represented a mark-up language which every web server is required to understand and interpret (Bernes-Lee 1994:793). </p>
		<p class="paragraph"> In terms of the future of the web, Bernes-Lee had proposed that from the web being a place of communication and learning, new market place, he envisioned that the web in the future web would have the implementation of a name service that would allow for documents be referenced by name, independent of their location, hypertext editors would also be able to create their hyperlinks in order to organise information. Further he envisioned that the web would have easy to user servers for low end machines for the purposes of easing the publication of information.  The vision of Bush to the creation of web by Tim Bernes-Lee has quite shifted in the 21st century, the web has seen a fast-paced development/growth. This proposal has surpassed Bernes-Leeâ€™s ideas of the future of the web and the development of the web. Hanson(2019) points out the evolving and changing world wide web brought people together what Bernes-Lee original proposal proposed was providing information and a system for individuals to share information remotely. The internet has evolved to allow companies individuals to create the websites, publish thoughts, opinions, the sharing of information and images. According to internetlivestats, the number of recorded websites that have been created is 1.5 billion as of 2018. The web is now used for personal purposes, business purposes but we have also seen how the information age has turned into surveillance capitalism. Hanson (2019) further points out that the message board, chat rooms, instant messaging apps which have allowed people to discuss all topics. Moreover, in terms of the negative aspects of the web, the web has seen browser wars whereby there is competition for dominance and power in the usage share of web browsers. The web has seen the companies like Google, Facebook to use it for the collection and selling of data for market purposes. This refers to the new economy in which the companies like Google, Facebook who collect and sell user information to third parties to get prediction results on user behaviour but also intend on changing it. However, in spite of the surveillance capitalism that we see online or of the use of the web, the web has allowed for the creation of applications like Twitter which have enabled for marginalized groups to voice their opinions like Arab Spring and Black Lives Matter. </p>
