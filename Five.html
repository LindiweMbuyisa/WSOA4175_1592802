 		 The web has become more than a framework encompassing/including human knowledge as a hypertext system. It has further become more than a pool of human knowledge as Bernes Lee points out (Bernes-Lee 1994: 791). It has made available or accessible a world wide web that has the most information than ever before, more than we have ever seen in comparison to a physical space like a library (Bernes-Lee 1994:791).  The worldwide web has inevitably grown to become a place where individuals share information more than just that people can host their business websites but also conduct financial transactions and shop online. This article as the originally published proposal suggested the foundation for the web as we have come to witness that the invention of the web has had an influential part in our lives. During the writing of the proposal what Bernes-Lee had envisioned with the web was a different number of things. The web defined as the idea of a boundless information world of which all the items or information had a reference which could be retrieved. It represented the address system (URL) which refers to the universal resource identifier, the network protocol which is used by the servers which were able to give the web servers performance and features. Further, the web had represented a mark-up language which every web server is required to understand and interpret (Bernes-Lee 1994:793). </p>
		<p class="paragraph"> In terms of the future of the web, Bernes-Lee had proposed that from the web being a place of communication and learning, new market place, he envisioned that the web in the future we would have the implementation of a name service that would allow for documents be referenced by name, independent of their location, hypertext editors would also be able to create their hyperlinks to organise information. Further, he envisioned that the web would have easy to use servers for low-end machines to ease the publication of information.  The vision of Bush to the creation of web by Tim Bernes-Lee has quite shifted in the 21st century, the web has seen a fast-paced development/growth. This proposal has surpassed Berners-Lee's ideas of the future of the web and the development of the web. Hanson(2019) points out the evolving and changing worldwide web brought people together what Bernes-Lee original proposal proposed was providing information and a system for individuals to share information remotely. The internet has evolved to allow companies individuals to create websites, publish thoughts, opinions, the sharing of information and images. According to internet live stats has recorded that there has been a billion websites created as of 2019. It is now used for personal purposes, business purposes but we have also seen how the information age has turned into surveillance capitalism. Hanson (2019) further points out that the message board, chat rooms, instant messaging apps which have allowed people to discuss all topics. Moreover, in terms of the negative aspects of the web, the web has seen browser wars whereby the is competition for dominance and power in the usage share of web browsers. The web has seen companies like Google, Facebook to use it for the collection and selling of data for market purposes. This refers to the new economy in which the companies like Google, Facebook who collect and sell user information to third parties to get prediction results on user behaviour but also intend on changing it (Zuboff 2019: 14-15). This information is valued in today's society. However, despite the surveillance capitalism that we see online or of the use of the web, the web has allowed for the creation of applications like Twitter which have allowed for marginalized groups to voice their opinions like Arab Spring and Black Lives Matter.  </p>
