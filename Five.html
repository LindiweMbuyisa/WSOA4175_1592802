 		The web has become more than a framework encompassing/including human knowledge  as a hypertext system. It has further become more than a pool of human knowledge as Bernes Lee points out. It has made available/accessible a world wide web that  has the most information than ever before than we have ever seen being in physical space like a library. The world wide web has inevitably grown to becoming a place where individuals share information more than just that people can transact business conduct financial transaction. The world wide web has come to stand for a number of different things. it has become the world of information in which all information can be a reference to define where they have been retrieved. 
		The address URL system which is a project implemented to make the world 
		Http refers to the world wide servers which give performance features. Html which refers to the browser language which the world wide web client can understand and translate. The web came about while Bernes Lee was working for the European Organisation for Nuclear Research. it ideas stem from the visionary of Bush who had problem with excessive information and not being able to find that very same information at a fast pace because of the lack of indexing and navigation. With this idea, Tim Bernes Lee came up with the idea of an internet that would allow for proper navigation. The world wide web has been the centre of development of the information age and is the primary means for people/individuals that people have been interacting with each via the internet. The web has seen a greater development with having the user be able to navigate to other web resources. This web resources has been able to navigate which in addition to text, web pages. This article presents the reader with definition of what the world wide web is, its relation to other systems and where the future of the web lies. The vision of Bush to the creation of web by Tim Bernes lee has quite shifted in the 21st century, the web has seen a fast-paced development/growth. it is now used for personal purposes, business purposes but we have also seen how the information age has turned into surveillance capitalism. This refers to the new economy in which the companies like Google, Facebook that user interact with collect and sell user information to third parties to get prediction results on user behaviour but also intend on changing it. This information which is valued in todayâ€™s society
