		<p class="subtitle">This blog post highlights Halavais exploration of the history of hyperlink and hypertext along with its problematic question of what is hypertext</p>
		<p class="date">25 August 2020</p>
		<p class="paragraph">  Similar to Wardrip-Fruin argument, Halavais points out that the question What does a hypertext mean,  it is a question that is problematic. Defining what a hyperlink does or is not sufficient enough to understand the definition of a hypertext. Halavais(2008: 39) suggests that defining a hyperlink we need to look at the nature, its use and social effects. The definition of a hyperlink is unitary /stable. There are a number of different ways in which a hyperlink could be theorised at different levels. Halavais argues that with the explosion/rise  of the World Wide Web; there has been an increasing awareness of hyperlinks being viewed as meaningful, malleable and powerful (Halavais 2008: 39). This is in opposition to the beginning views of the definition of what a hyperlink is. This has also changed the way hyperlinks are viewed and we are able to see the hyperlinks in the larger networked structure (Halavais 2008:39). further this has changed how we use the hyperlink or exploit it. </p>
		<p class="paragraph">
		 As hyperlink networks are easily used,  Halavais(2008:39) points out that the understanding of a hyperlink will enable for us to  be able to view hyperlink as more than just  way of going about or trying to (automatically) request document from the server. Halavais suggest that hyperlinks are a form of citation. He further suggest that hyperlinks are another form of a citation/similar to a citation there is a relation between a citation and the development of a hyperlink. Halavais points out that the idea behind a hyperlink was a reference that automatically brought the user to a specific part of a cited work. However, this idea and its inventors were blind to what a hyperlink can do and its implications. But trying to understand a hyperlink we need to look at what it means to cite. Looking at the history of hyperlinking Halavais demonstrates  that we can see it began from citations which are a form of textual link that is demonstrated from the earliest texts like  the commentaries on religious texts to Talmudic scholarship. </p>
		 <p class="paragraph"> A citation is also a form of engaging in a conversation through the use of technologies of indexing plus referencings. It also suggest that the writer is supporting the ideas of the scholar’s arguments. Citations also serve a pedagogical role, directing the reader to helpful resources (Halavais 2008: 40). Halavais points out that the text become a relatively solitary endeavour instead of becoming a textual conversation. Halavais considers citations a form of hyper conversation, citations are also a way of engaging in a discourse/community of shared thoughts/meanings (Halavais 2008:41). Citations were invented for a different reasons but also intended to be used for a different ways as well. But what is significant is that citations have played an important significant role in the development of social knowledge. Halavais points out that as much as the idea of hyperlinking pre-dates to the citations/referencing period, this has gone way beyond citations, links resemble Bush’ visionary of the memex a system file structure that also has significantly changed. Hyperlinks have now taken on a new role like clicking a hyperlink may mean changing the camera orientation. Halavais points out that hyperlinking has changed and become more than just a link, it becomes difficult to point out what the meaning of a hyperlink or what does it mean when someone hyperlinks. While this topic has been interrogated, Halavais points out that there is a lack of scholarly text answering this question or providing an answer to this question, and that means the that hyperlinks hold social meaning and it would be impossible to offer a single definition to the hyperlinks. </p>
