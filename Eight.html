		<h1 class="title">"The hyperlik as an organising principle"</h1>
		<p class="date">25 August 2020</p>
		<p class="paragraph"> Similar to Wardrip-Fruin argument, Halavais points out that the question What does a hypertext mean is a problematic question. Defining what a hyperlink does is not sufficient enough to understanding what a hypertext is. Halavais(2008: 39) suggests that defining a hyperlink we need to look at its nature, its use and social effects. The definition of a hyperlink is unitary /stable. There are several different ways in which a hyperlink could be theorised at different levels. Halavais argues that with the explosion/rise of the World Wide Web, there has been an increasing awareness of hyperlinks being viewed as meaningful, malleable and powerful (Halavais 2008: 39). This is in opposition to the beginning views of the definition of what a hyperlink is. This has also changed the way hyperlinks are viewed and we can see the hyperlinks in the larger networked structure (Halavais 2008:39). Further, this has changed how we use the hyperlinks or exploit it. </p>
		<p class="paragraph">
		 As hyperlink networks are easily used, Halavais(2008:39) points out that this understanding of a hyperlink we will be able to view as more than just way of going about or trying to (automatically) request document from the server. Halavais suggest that hyperlinks are a form of citation. He further suggests that hyperlinks are another form of a citation as there is a relation between a citation and the development of a hyperlink. Halavais points out that the idea behind a hyperlink was a reference that automatically brought the user to a specific part of a cited work. However, this idea and its inventors were blind to what a hyperlink can do and its implications. But trying to understand a hyperlink we need to look at what it means to cite. Looking at the history of hyperlinking Halavais demonstrates that we can see it began from citations which are a form of textual link that is demonstrated from the earliest texts like the commentaries on religious texts to Talmudic scholarship. </p>
		 <p class="paragraph"> A citation is also a form of engaging in a conversation through the use of technologies of indexing plus referencing without using citations. It also suggests that the writer is supporting the ideas of the scholar's arguments. Citations also serve a pedagogical role, directing the reader to helpful resources (Halavais 2008: 40). Halavais points out that the text becomes a relatively solitary endeavour instead of becoming a textual conversation. Halavais considers citations a form of hyper conversation, citations are also a way of engaging in a discourse/community of shared thoughts/meanings (Halavais 2008:41). Citations were invented for different reasons but also intended to be used for different ways as well. However, what is significant is that citations have played a significant role in the development of social knowledge. Halavais points out that as much as the idea of hyperlinking pre-dates to the citations/referencing period, this has gone way beyond citations, the concept of links resemble Bush' visionary of the memex a system file structure that also has significantly changed. Hyperlinks now take on a new role for example clicking a hyperlink may mean changing the camera orientation or changing the background colour of the webpage. Halavais points out that hyperlinking has changed and become more than just a link, it becomes difficult to point out what the meaning of a hyperlink or what does it means when someone uses hyperlinks. While this topic has been interrogated, Halavais points out that there is a lack of scholarly reserach interrogating this question or providing an answer to this question, and that means the that hyperlinks hold social meaning and it would be impossible to offer a single definition to the term, hyperlinks. </p>
