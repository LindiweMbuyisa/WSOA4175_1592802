		<h1 class="title">"Representation as a form of myth, visual communication and persuasion"</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">This blog post is based on Kidd's reading on representation</p>
		<p class="date">22 July 2020</p>
		<p class="paragraph"> Representations are socially constructed. They are made-up within the frame of a 		particular understanding of the world. When looking into representation and myth, Kidd (2015: 23) 		points out that an object can be interpreted at the denotative and connotative level which refer to 	the relationship of what is seen versus what is not seen at the level of the myth. For example, the  		Apple logo, the denotation literally is an apple and the connotative level connotes an expensive, 	desirable object. A text, image cannot just be read at its denotative level. These connotations 	eventually create myths as they are normalised and spread by the media.
			 This is similar to Hall's theory of representation which suggest that the the media uses stereotypes. Stereotypes refers to the oversimplification of a particular group of people. For example, Men are often portrayed as the hero and strong on adverts versus Women who are represented as caring and often feature in adverts that would be associated with house chores or cleaning products. Hall's theory of representation suggest that these stereotypes are often defined by those in power. These people are the white, heterosexual male. </p>

			<p class= "paragraph">We can see that with Orientalism which is the process by which the western media create representations of the Middle East and Asia that is biased and a misrepresentation of these groups (Kidd 2015: 24-25). This representation is from the perspective of the media that is of <em>“non-native onlooker”</em> (Kidd 2015: 25). For example, games often present the player with Arabic characters, but these are often labelled and represented as terrorists in the game. The author points out that they are also usually dark-skinned and would be shouting Allahu-Akabr further carrying a gun most of the time an AK-47 </p>

			<p class="paragraph"> Similar to the media and how it represents people of colour particularly black people in comparison to other races. As an example, Daily Mail's representation of two footballers. The black individual is critised for spending that much money versus the white footballer who is praised by the newspaper. This does not mean these representation cannot be rejected by the audience. However, the media intend on normalising these representations. </p>

			With visual literacy and visual communication like images, they are open to different interpretations as compared to other mediums of communication. In terms of the connotative functions of images; they depend on the context in which the image is used. The reading and meaning of an image are informed by their mode of presentation, production context-where the image has been produced, the historical context, the context of the image in relation to other images and the reception and reading of the image.

			<h2>Now we can find representation in the form of data visualisation</h2>
			<p class="paragraph"> Data visualisation brings together images, symbols, tables and graphical content and they tell a story by using data (Kidd 2015:30). Data visualisation has become interactive as well. This data is presented  in ways that the audience can grasp or understand  difficult concepts or identify new patterns. Similar to image representations, data visualisations are constructed. Kidd (2015: 31) defines data visualisation as speculative and further suggest that an infographic cannot tell the entire story. This is similar to media text as the individual in charge of collecting the data or even analysing it; they are informed by their ideologies. Similar to media texts, data visualisation is about the construction which refers to the individual deciding on the angle, layout or what choices they make in trying to represent the information. Data visualisation also includes selection process whereby the individual selects particular facts, data points overs others but also, we have to consider what is not included as part of this data. This data visualisation or representation can also be influenced by the ideologies, what the person's beliefs and values are. This ultimately dictate what we see as the audience and readers/viewers of the data or images or media texts.
			This means that representation of texts, images or data are constructed. Kidd(2015:29) suggest that they do not reflect the reality however have the ability to shape it. </p>
