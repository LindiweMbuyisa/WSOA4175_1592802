		<h1 class="title">"What hypertext is?"</h1>
		<p class="date">18 August 2020</p>
		<p class="paragraph"> In this paper, Wardrip-Fruin questions what hypertext is, as the definition has been adapted because of it being used by different disciplines. Wardrip-Fruin points out that hypertext was identified and first used by Ted Nelson who is the creator of the web. It began as a term for textual forms of hypermedia. This definition was in opposition to the definition of hypertext in the literary community that defines hypertext as a link. This definition also is in opposition with the definition used by the research community. The definition has a wide range in terms of its definition (2004:126). In reference to Ryan, Wardrip-Fruin highlights that hypertext is the unfolding of the text by the reader/user as they select and click on areas which are hyperlinks allowing the user to bring other parts of the text (Wardrip-Fruin 2004:126). While Aarseth’s definition refers to hypertext as a concept whereby there is a direct connection from one position in a text to another. For example a website, hyperlinks are underlined texts and by clicking on the text the user is directed to a different section or another page of the website. </p>

		<p class="paragraph"> Wardrip-Fruin argues that defining what is hypertext is similar to asking a questions like what psychoanalysis is  or what is communism. Wardrip-Fruin suggests that hypertext as a concept has been adapted and has had multiple definitions further different definitions for different contexts. Wardrip-Fruin argues that it is better to look at the definition as coined by Ted Nelson. Ted Nelson defines the term <em> "hypertext as a body of written or pictorial material which is interconnected in a complex way that it would not be possible to present or represent on paper" </em> (Wardrip-Fruin 2004: 127). Ted Nelson’s definition also does not include the word link as part of the definition. This means Hypertext is a non-linear navigation which does not follow a logical sequence and  is different from turning a page when reading a book. It is an interactive way in which the reader can choose what information to read first, look at or interact with the page.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">Hyperlinks which are referred to as the foundation of the whole idea of the Web. In reference to Tim Berners-Lee’s who looked at the 3 main aspects that make up the web which is the URL which is the address system that keeps track of the web documents, the http which refers to the transfer protocol that tries to find the documents when given their URLs and html which is markup language of the web but also a document format which enables for embedding of hyperlinks. When looking at the proposal and research presented by both Tim Berners Lee but also the English and Engelbert, it aimed at offering an easy way to read, navigate the web but that idea has been extended and is now not only trying to provide an easy way of navigating and reading documents on the web but also now provides access to images, videos and binary data but these extended ideas have not changed the original vision of the web rather extended the idea. We can use links, hyperlinks to access documents without having to type long URLs whenever wanting to access a document. This has changed the web and usability of it. It has also become of significance to the web, today. Hyperlinks give a different meaning to interactivity. The concept of hyperlinks is used in different ways today. It is used as hashtags on twitter-by clicking on a hashtag it directs the user to different tweets that have used the same hashtag in their post. When writing research, we often reference our sources that is another form of hypertext and hyperlinking, The idea of hypertext has further extended to hypermedia which refers to multimedia facilities such as videos and sound (Wardrip-Fruin 2004: 127).  Like YouTube which incorporates/uses both the concept of hypermedia and hypertext, has embedded videos but in offers description where the creator can input extra information in the description text whereby the user can click and will redirect to another document on the internet. Looking at these concepts these are ways of connecting us to the any piece of information and knowledge in the World Wide Web. Nowadays, clicking video as well can redirect the user to a different page. Hypertext is has become an extension of the computer and the human mind.  It is interesting to see how the hypertext theory or as concept has evolved considering and recognising that a lot of social media platforms now use hypertext concept for example Pinterest is a great example of the combination of hypermedia and hypertext as images. gifs like animations which are links to other images/documents. Clicking an image takes the user to a different images in relation to that specific image and so on. </p>

		<p class="paragraph">In conclusion, Wardrip-Fruin suggests that the definition is changed and been updated but he points at the definition that is historically based and further, suggests that the definition that should be used needs to be historically based (Wardrip-Fruin 2004:127). </p>
