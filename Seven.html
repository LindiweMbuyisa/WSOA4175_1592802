		<h1 class="title">"What hypertext is?"</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">This blog post highlights Wardrip-Fruin's research about hypertext</p>
		<p class="date">18 August 2020</p>
		

		<p class="paragraph"> In this paper, Wardrip-Fruin questions what hypertext is.  As the definition has been adapted because of it being used by different disciplines. Wardrip-Fruin points out that hypertext was identified and first used by Ted Nelson who is the creator of the web. it began  as a term for forms of hypermedia that are textual. This definition was in opposition to the definition of hypertext in the literary community that views at hypertext as a form of a link. This definition also is in opposition with definition of hypertext in terms of the research community. When we look at the definition of the word hypertext in terms of the research community. The definition has a wide range in terms of its definition. Wardrip-Fruin (2004:126) points out that the definition in the literary community; hypertext is a link. In reference to Ryan, Wardrip-Fruin highlights that hypertext the reader would be the person unfolding the text as they select and click on areas which are hyperlinks that allows for the user to bring other parts of the text (Wardrip-Fruin 2004:126). While also the Aarseth’s perspective /definition; hypertext is a concept whereby there is a direct connection from one position in a text to another. For example, on a website, hyperlinks are underlined and by clicking on the link  the user is directed to a different section/part of the webpage. </p>

		<p class="paragraph"> Wardrip-Fruin suggests that posing the question of what hypertext is; it is a similar question to for example what psychoanalysis is or what is communism. Wardrip-Fruin suggests that this question what hypertext is; the definition of hypertext has adapted and has multiple definitions and can be defined in different context. Wardrip-Fruin points it is better to look at the definition as coined by Ted Nelson. Wardrip-Fruin points out that the definition which is a “body of written/pictorial material interconnected in such a way that it could not be presented on paper” (Wardrip-Fruin 2004: 127). With Ted Nelson’s definition also not including the word link as part of the definition. Only the definition including the word link is later introduced. </p>
		<p class="paragraph">In conclusion, Wardrip-Fruin suggests that the definition is changed and been updated but he points at the definition that is historically based and further suggests that the definition that should be used needs to be historically based (Wardrip-Fruin 2004:127).  </p>
