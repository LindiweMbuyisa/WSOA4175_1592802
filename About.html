		<p class="paragraph"> I am student currently studying BA Digital Arts with an interest in game design and user experience. Hence my work focuses on games, user experience design- anything related to the web. My journey as a creative began as hobby but has become more than just that. It has become a form of expression. Pursuing this degree has opened me to different experiences through to working with different mediums like web, interactive media and game design eventually challenged myself to learn user experience design and motion graphics. I like to explore different genres but mainly 2D games. In terms of the inspiration for my projects, they are often inspired by other games, my own experiences and politics. </p>
