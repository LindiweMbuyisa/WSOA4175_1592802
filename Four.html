		<h1 class="title">Behind the idea of the Website</h1>
		<p class="subtitle"></p>
		<p class="date"> 15 August 2020</p>
	
		<p class="paragraph"> The main design goal for this website was to use it as a porfolio which could including my design centric projects that would showcase my game design projects and motion graphics-playing around with typography. I wanted to include UX projects however I wanted to ensure that the user is not confused about the different projects and question what I do hence I just wanted to show only game design projects.  With this website, I wanted to create a portfolio website that will be a holder of my projects, my blogs posts that engage with the weekly readings. I have opted to use this website to display what I have done,  design projects that I have done individually during my degree but also beyond my degree. These projects will document the process of the project from start to finish. By creating this website as a design portfolio, I am not only looking at just using it to showcase my design projecs that I have done throughout my degree however I also intend on using it demonstrate my website design skills with the website itself further my web development skills.

		<p class="paragraph"> The main colour that I have decided to use is blue (main primary colour), black (which is the secondary colour) and it will be used for text whilst the pink and white will be additional colours which I have decided to use for buttons and adding contrast and colour to the website. With the inspiration for the website, I went with portfolio websites that used colour in a very interesting way and used bright colours but in a very mindful way. The navigation systems were different and took a contemporary approach to navigation systems, they were easy to navigate. This is what I imagined for my portfolio/website. Considering the feedback for the creative component of the website, I have decided to change the colour used for the subtitles, titles which was the pink because it was underlined and in colour in communicated to the user that it was a link. Hence I have decided to use black as the colour for the titles and any other text that  are not links. I have also change the blog landing page as there was negative hence I have decided to use cards to avoid the negative space.

		<p class="paragraph">In light of the UI and UX lecture, I have decided to design both the web and mobile version of the website. I have included the mobile wireframes to show how the content might be structured considering the mobile phone has a smaller screen. Considering that the creative page is a grid based layout, on a mobile format the display had to change. I have considered information architecture which is the structure of information and how it can be organized on the page. I have decided to change the font to a single font-family, Lato but using a different variations of the font but still considering consitency. In terms of alignment in light of UI/UX lecture, I have considered that the blog post content needs to be aligned in a composition. In reference to the lecture, a composition has the ability to look clear, confident and formal if aligned properly. Considering that the blog post content is essay-like and critical engagement with the readings, I intended to have the blog come across as formal in constrast to the other pages of the website which will include a play with typography. In terms of the visual hierarchy, as this allows for users to skim/scan at the content/information.  In terms of the of the blog post page content, I have decided to break up the elements like the paragraphs by using elements like images, headings to balance the size and weight of the paragraphs, as large blocks of text can overwhlem the user.</p>
