		<h1 class="title">Behind the idea of the Website</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">With this blog post, it focuses on the webpage, describing the idea that I based around this website, it also discusses the rationale, what I am making further the reasoning behind the chosen format and content. Further it highlights the original wireframes, functionality of the website and user journey, style guide like the colours, fonts I have decided to use. This is further discussed as to how I have adjusted and changed the wireframes and my idea with regards to thinking about UI and UX of the webpage. </p>

		<p class="paragraph"> The main design goal for this website is for the usability for a portfolio including my design centric projects from Game Design perspective and Web/UI, user experience further motion graphics. With this website, I wanted to create a portfolio website that will be a holder of my projects, my blogs posts that engage with the weekly readings. I have opted to use this website to display what I have done,  design projects that I have done individually during my degree but also beyond my degree. These projects will document the process of the project from start to finish. By creating this website as a design portfolio, I am not only looking at just using it to showcase my design projecs that I have done throughout my degree however I also intend on using it demonstrate my website design skills with the website itself further my web development skills. I also want this portfolio to show the work I want to do after my degree.

		<p class="paragraph"> The main colour that I have decided to use is blue (main primary colour), black (which is the secondary colour) and it will be used for text whilst the pink and white will be additional colours which I have decided to use for buttons and adding contrast and colour to the website. With the inspiration for the website, I went with portfolio websites that used colour in a very interesting way and used bright colours but in a very mindful way. The navigation systems were different and took a contemporary approach to navigation systems, they were easy to navigate. This is what I imagined for my portfolio/website. Considering the feedback for the creative component of the website, i have decided to change the colour used for the subtitles, titles which was th pink as user would expect that text to be link because it was underlined and in colour which communicated to them that could be a link. Hence I have decided to use black as the colour for the titles and any toher text that is not links or significant text.

		<p class="paragraph">In light of the UI and UX lecture, I have decided to design both the web and mobile version of the website. I have included the mobile wireframes to show how the content might be structured considering the mobile phone has a smaller screen. Considering that the creative page is a grid based layout, on a mobile format the display had to change. I have considered information architecture which is about deciding how to structure the information and how it can be organized on the page. I have decided to change the font to a single font-family; Lato. Using a single font -family to achieve consistency throughout the website. In terms of alignment in light of UI/UX lecture, I have considered that the blog post content needs to be aligned in a composition. In reference to the lecture, a composition has the ability to look clear, confident and formal if aligned properly. Considering that the blog post content is essay-like and critical engagement with the readings, i intended to have the blog come across as formal in constrast to the other pages of the website which will include illustrations, creative and come across as friendly. In terms of the visual hierarchy, as this allows for users to skim/scan at the content/information.  In terms of the of the blog post page content, I have decided to break up the elements like the paragraphs by using elements like images, headings to balance the size and weight of the paragraphs, as large blocks of text can overwhlem the user.</p>
